Conclusion: From the above outputs it can be seen that the accuracies fall of training, testing and validation sets occurs when C and gamma take smaller values. Also, when C has a larger value and so is the value of gamma, then the accuracy of test and validation sets fall down.
Therefore, to have a better (mean) accuracy it is important to keep larger C value and relatively smaller gamma value.
